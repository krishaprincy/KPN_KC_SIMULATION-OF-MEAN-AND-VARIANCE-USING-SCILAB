# SIMULATION-OF-MEAN-AND-VARIANCE-USING-SCILAB

## AIM:
To write a program for mean, variance and cross correlation in SCILAB and verify the output.

## EQUIPMENTS Needed

•	Computer with i3 Processor
•	SCI LAB


## Algorithm
1.	Define	the	Function:	Specify the	function	you	want	to	simulate.	For	example, f(x)=sin⁡(x)f(x) = \sin(x)f(x)=sin(x) or any other function.
2.	Generate Sample Points: Decide on the range and the number of sample points. Generate these sample points within the desired range.
3.	Evaluate the Function: Compute the function values at each of these sample points.
4.	Compute Mean, Variance and Cross Correlation: Use Scilab's functions to calculate the mean and variance of the computed function values.
5.	Display Results: Output the computed mean variance and Cross Correlation PROCEDURE
•	Refer Algorithms and write code for the experiment.
•	Open SCILAB in System
•	Type your code in New Editor
•	Save the file
•	Execute the code
•	If any Error, correct it in code and execute again
•	Verify the generated results


## PROGRAM




## CALCULATION





## OUTPUT

## RESULT:
Thus the mean , variance and cross correlation are executed in Scilab and output is verified.
